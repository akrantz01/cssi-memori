# Memori

Memori is a set of games to help you practice your mental math and memorization of the periodic table.
It is built with [P5.js](https://p5js.org), [Chart.js](https://chartjs.org), [Bootstrap CSS](https://getbootstrap.com), and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com).
All authentication, hosting, and data persistence is handled through Firebase.

Memori was built by Stephanie Chen, Alex Krantz, and Sashrika Pandey during project week of Google CSSI 2020.
